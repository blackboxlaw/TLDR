# The lexDAO Registry ✒️ TLDR
> Transactional Scripts for Legal and Ethereal Deal Security

TLDR is an interactive registry and market on Ethereum that allows anyone to select curated "lexScripts" for two main types of transactions:

(1) **Digital Dollar Retainers (DDR)**, and (2) **Digital Covenants (DC)**

From our initial observations, we believe that blockchain-enabled deals primarly fall into these categories and present immediate opportunities for utilizing transactional scripts (or, smart contracts) to scope out efficiency gains.

## TLDR Governance

TLDR is maintained by lexScribes who admit each other as *lexDAO* participants. In order to coordinate lexScript contributions and good stewardship of related disputes, TLDR implements a minimal DAO design inspired by Manuel Araoz *[digital violence](https://maraoz.com/2019/02/11/digital-life/)*, wherein, participants police each other's reputation and can effectively 'disbar' fully disreputable lexScribes.

To incentivize quality contributions to TLDR, each DDR that imports a lexScript will pay the requested fee of the author lexScribe. For example, a DDR with a deliverable rate of "500 DAI" might pay 5 DAI on TLDR transactions to satisfy a "lexRate" of 1% ("100" as set within script).

Reputable lexScribes within lexDAO are also able to arbitrate DDR disputes and claim a 5% fee for such TLDR service, offering more opportunities for lexDAO monetization and value to reputation. 

Ether and LEX tokens (minted from TLDR service, lexScripts and arbitration) may be staked for lexDAO reputation, with different programatic cooldown periods as set within TLDR.
